Run the notebooks in this order
Make sure you have KDDTest+ and KDDTrain+ txt files all other csv files would be generated by running the notebooks sequentially

1) Exploratory Data Analysis v2.ipynb

2) The ones below can be run in parallel
Decision Tree v2.ipynb
Naive Bayes v2.ipynb
KNN v2.ipynb
Logistic Regression.ipynb
Base Learners ADASYN, SMOTE - CV Scores; PCA Variances Calculated.ipynb

3) The ones below can be run in parallel
